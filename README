NAME
    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Recent - A POE component to retrieve recent
    CPAN uploads.

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use POE qw(Component::SmokeBox::Recent);

      $|=1;

      POE::Session->create(
            package_states => [
              'main' => [qw(_start recent)],
            ],
      );

      $poe_kernel->run();
      exit 0;

      sub _start {
        POE::Component::SmokeBox::Recent->recent( 
            url => 'http://www.cpan.org/',
            event => 'recent',
        );
        return;
      }

      sub recent {
        my $hashref = $_[ARG0];
        if ( $hashref->{error} ) {
            print $hashref->{error}, "\n";
            return;
        }
        print $_, "\n" for @{ $hashref->{recent} };
        return;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Recent is a POE component for retrieving
    recently uploaded CPAN distributions from the CPAN mirror of your
    choice.

    It accepts a url and an event name and attempts to download and parse
    the RECENT file from that given url.

    It is part of the SmokeBox toolkit for building CPAN Smoke testing
    frameworks.

CONSTRUCTOR
    recent
        Takes a number of parameters:

          'url', the full url of the CPAN mirror to retrieve the RECENT file from, only http ftp and file are currently supported, mandatory;
          'event', the event handler in your session where the result should be sent, mandatory;
          'session', optional if the poco is spawned from within another session;
          'context', anything you like that'll fit in a scalar, a ref for instance;
          'rss', set to a 'true' value to retrieve from the rss file instead of RECENT file.
          'epoch', an epoch timestamp less than the current time but greater than an year ago.

        The 'session' parameter is only required if you wish the output
        event to go to a different session than the calling session, or if
        you have spawned the poco outside of a session.

        The 'rss' parameter if set will indicate that the poco should
        retrieve recent uploads from the "modules/01modules.mtime.rss" file
        instead of the "RECENT" file. The rss file contains the 150 most
        recent uploads to CPAN and is more up to date than the "RECENT"
        file.

        The 'epoch' parameter should be a valid epoch timestamp less than
        the current time but greater than a year ago. Setting this will
        cause the component to use CPAN::Recent::Uploads to obtain a list of
        distributions uploaded since the 'epoch' time given. This enables
        more grandular control of listing dists than simply retrieving the
        "RECENT" file.

        The poco does it's work and will return the output event with the
        result.

OUTPUT EVENT
    This is generated by the poco. ARG0 will be a hash reference with the
    following keys:

      'recent', an arrayref containing recently uploaded distributions; 
      'error', if something went wrong this will contain some hopefully meaningful error messages;
      'context', if you supplied a context in the constructor it will be returned here;
